You are invited to participate in a study in which you will be asked to come up with questions that can be best answered by different agents--namely voice assistants (e.g., Siri, Alexa), adults, and children. After the study, we will ask you to provide some basic demographic information. The session should last between 30 to 60 minutes. 

 

Compensation. You will be paid $3 for your participation.
