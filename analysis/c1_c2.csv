"1","Some of it was me answering the questions as couldn't guess either way. Questions about spirituality were difficult without my own opinion. Thought wrong answers or simple answers were more likely to be human.  Some answers seemed to have too much information.  The full stops seemed odd and I assumed they were AI.  Answers that were a little random seemed human.
Thing is the AI could have a bank of 20,000 answers to chose from for each question, we think we are unique with unique thoughts - this is probably wrong.",0,0,1,0,0,0

Some of them could have easily been either so it was a bit tricky ",1,0,0,0,0,0

"7","In general I decided an answer was human if it was short or used more general terms rather than specifics. For example, responding 'nope' to a question is more likely to be a human response in my opinion.

"12","When deciding what responses belonged to the human adult, I would attempt to decipher the overall tone. I've found that AI machines may sometimes overcompensate in their attempt to replicate that of a human persona, and maybe say too much rather than getting straight to the point. Likewise, although there may be colloquial terms used, I assume AI is on average more formal in their communication, so as to appear neutral and calm. I also looked for this neutrality when opinion based questions were asked - I'd assume a human may be more straightforward with their answer, whilst the AI would be a bit more nuanced and open.",1,1,0,1,0,0

However, this didn’t apply in all cases, sometimes the question did call for a bit more detail and then I felt a one word answer was more likely to be the AI. Use of abbreviations and slang made me think it was the human. Also, accurate answers to questions a human would be unlikely to know the answer to suggested it was the AI. ",1,0,1,0,0,0

I did occasionally feel as if I wanted to answer with which ever statement fitted my feeling or opinion, so had to stop and think about the real question !

"27","The answers I suspected of being AI gave more information than was asked for or inappropriate answers to the questions with perfect sentence structures. With very difficult questions such as the value of pi, it was able to give an accurate answer.

The answers I believed to be human used terms such as 'nah' or 'nope' instead of no, gave brief answers, offering no more information than was asked for, and were unable to answer more difficult questions, offering guesses instead. They were more vague, for example, saying just 'sunny' instead of giving the exact temperature.",0,0,1,0,0,0

Anything that seemed more personable or what I would personally answer - obviously information questions, like 30 digits of pi and super big prime numbers, nobody but a maths nut would know so I was more inclined to pick AI. 
But on answers where they have cultural quips (like No, do I look like Elon Musk? when asked if theyve been to mars), or answers that seemed more sassy and emotional seemed “human”. unless they were too emotional, too descriptive?It’s hard to say.
